    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I have had a lifelong passion for cinema. You can keep an eye on what I've been watching and what I think on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mepheisto/">Letterboxd.</a></li>
      <li>Now I'm free to read non-academic texts, I have been trying to work through a long list of novels I've always wanted to read. You can keep up with my progress on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20323045-jake-bevan">Goodreads</a>. </li>
      <Li>I like to cook, particularly East Asian food. A future update to this page will include recipes!</Li>
      <li>I love to travel and take photographs. Once I've got a little bit more coding skill, my photos will be all over the place on this site.</li>
